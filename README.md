# Git Training
Small git training sandbox project for training purposes.

1. We are going to make some changes to the project in a branch, push them to git. We are going to process a pull request
to integration and then retrieve the project in a cloned space from another user who will add some changes to the README,
publish them and process a pull request.

1.1. I am going to add changes, then I am going to commit and push these changes. Finally, I am going to make a pull
request into the integration branch.

2. I am the owner of the repo and I want to work in an organized manner. What I will do is to create a work branch and
then when I am done I will merge the work into the integration branch.
